## ❗What It Can & Can’t Do

✅ **Auto-completes most Galxe tasks**, like:
- On-chain checks
- Snapshot voting
- Social likes, retweets
- Quiz completions

❌ You still have to manually:
- Join Discords
- Verify Discord roles
- Follow on X/Twitter

These steps can’t be automated due to platform limits and bot restrictions.
